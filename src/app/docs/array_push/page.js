            I know... I know... Looks like PHP syntax. But I can this is more expressive than something like LP...(not that nonesense) L? no we don't take Ls over here.
            Anyways... Hermes offers a simple way to work with lists/arrays and with the above command you can add an element to an array. If the array doesn't already exist in the Hermes server, it'll be created and that element appended to it. If you do it without any values it'll create an empty array.
            Note: Arrays in Hermes are not associative (like in PHP), they're more like lists
